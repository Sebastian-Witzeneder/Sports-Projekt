                      Ice climbing is the activity of ascending inclined ice formations. Usually, ice climbing refers to roped and protected climbing of features such as icefalls, frozen waterfalls, and cliffs and rock slabs covered with ice refrozen from flows of water. For the purposes of climbing, ice can be broadly divided into two spheres, alpine ice and water ice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">Alpine ice is found in a mountain environment, usually requires an approach to reach, and is often climbed in an attempt to summit a mountain. Water ice is usually found on a cliff or other outcropping beneath water flows. Alpine ice is frozen precipitation whereas water ice is a frozen liquid flow of water. Most alpine ice is generally one component of a longer route and often less technical, having more in common with standard glacier travel, while water ice is selected largely for its technical challenge.</p>

                    <p class="text-white mb-4">Austria has a lot of mountains.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">Some Places would be: Kaunertal Valley; Ã–tztal Valley; Tiroler Zugspitz Arena.</p>

                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Insulated ice climbing boots:</font> When ice climbing, you use devices called crampons (which are sharpened steel spikes attached to your foot) to help you gain traction.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Climbing harness:</font> A harness secures a person to a rope or an anchor point.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Climbing helmet:</font> Climbing helmets are designed to protect you against several common climbing scenarios; for example, when: rocks or hardware get kicked loose above you.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Ixe Axe:</font> An ice axe consists of at least five components: Head; Pick; Adze; Hammer; Shaft; Spike.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Carbiners:</font> A carabiner or karabiner is a specialized type of shackle, a metal loop with a spring-loaded gate used to quickly and reversibly connect components.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Quickdrwas:</font> It allows the climbing rope to run freely through bolt anchors or other protection while leading. A quickdraw consists of two carabiners connected by a semi-rigid material.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h2 class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Hystory of sport</font></h2>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">Ice climbing started in Europe in the 19th century as an off shoot of mountaineering.  The first significant development in this sport came in 1908 when Oscar Eckenstein designed a type of claw tooth that attached to the bottom of a boot. This was the first crampon. In 1932 Laurent Grivel attached the two front points that all crampons now have letting climbers kick into the ice for stability and allowed for steeper ice to be climbed.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">In 1966, Yvon Chouinard, owner of Patagonia, began experimenting with ice axes and designed what is now the modern day ice ax. Crampons and ice axes make climbing easier and allowed climbers to ascend ice that is even steeper than vertical.</p>
