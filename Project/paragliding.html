                  <p class="text-white mb-4">Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders</p>
                  <p class="text-white mb-4">Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <h2 class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">In Austria</font></h2>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">Austria has a lot of mountains.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">One Places would be: Papillon Alpen-Paragliding-Center Stubai</p>
                    <p></p>
                  <p></p>
                  <h2 class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Equipment</font></h2>
                  <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Wing:</font> The paraglider wing or canopy is usually what is known in engineering as a ram-air airfoil. Such wings comprise two layers of fabric that are connected to internal supporting material in such a way as to form a row of cells.</p>
                  <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Harness:</font> The pilot is loosely and comfortably buckled into a harness, which offers support in both the standing and sitting positions.</p>
                  <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Radio:</font> Radio communications are used in training, to communicate with other pilots, and to report where and when they intend to land. These radios normally operate on a range of frequencies.</p>
                  <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">GNSS:</font> GNSS is a necessary accessory when flying competitions, where it has to be demonstrated that way-points have been correctly passed. The recorded GNSS track of a flight can be used to analyze flying technique or can be shared with other pilots.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <h2 class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Hystory of sport</font></h2>
                  <p class="text-white mb-4">In 1966, Canadian Domina Jalbert was granted a patent for a multi-cell wing type aerial deviceâ€”"a wing having a flexible canopy constituting an upper skin and with a plurality of longitudinally extending ribs forming in effect a wing corresponding to an airplane wing airfoil.</p>
                  <p class="text-white mb-4">n 1954, Walter Neumark predicted (in an article in Flight magazine) a time when a glider pilot would be "able to launch himself by running over the edge of a cliff or down a slope".</p>
                  <p class="text-white mb-4">In 1961, the French engineer Pierre Lemongine produced improved parachute designs that led to the Para-Commander.</p>
