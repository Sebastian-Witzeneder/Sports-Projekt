                    <p class="text-white mb-4">Downhill, is a variant of various sports, especially cycling (more precisely mountain biking). It is important to cover a downhill stretch in the shortest possible time.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">In English usage, downhill is synonymous with downhill skiing as a discipline of alpine skiing.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">In downhill (“DH” for short) - analogous to skiing - you have to ride a closed, exclusively downhill stretch with special bicycles as quickly as possible. In the roughest terrain, riddled with natural obstacles and at speeds of over 70 km/h, the sports equipment must be under full control at every second. The difficulty is to find the fine line between maximum speed and low risk of falling. Downhill is also practiced as a competitive sport.

                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Downhill bike:</font> High speeds and rough terrain place special demands on the technology of downhill bikes and limit their area of ​​use to downhill riding.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Stability:</font> All components are primarily designed for stability. Light weight is important, but there are factors that are more important. The weight of a downhill bike is around 15-25 kg.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Suspension:</font> In order to keep the uneven ground away from the rider and to increase riding safety, downhill bikes usually have shock absorbers on the front of the bike fork as well as on the rear wheel with a large spring deflection of around 200 mm.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Brakes:</font> Fully hydraulic disc brakes with a brake disc diameter of around 200 mm are mainly used. They guarantee high braking performance in all weather conditions.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Tires:</font> Very large and stable tires provide more grip and stability. Different profiles and rubber compounds are used depending on the weather and the nature of the ground.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Cockpit:</font> Wide handlebars between 680 and 800 mm, which have an increase between 15 and 50 mm. Many drivers prefer a flat cockpit, which is why flat bars, i.e. handlebars without elevation, are also used. So-called DirectMount stems are increasingly being used as stems, which are screwed directly onto the upper fork crown to prevent the handlebars from twisting in the event of a fall. However, this also means that serious falls can cause damage to the fork, stem or handlebars.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Seating zone:</font> Stable and rather uncomfortable racing bike or cross-country saddles, which have a steep incline in the opposite direction of the rear wheel.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h2 class="text-white mb-4"><font color="red">Hystory of sport</font></h2>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">
                      The 1st downhill time-trial race took place in Fairfax, California on October 21, 1976 on a fireroad now referred to as Repack Road, due to the need to repack the hub brake after each descent. The bikes used were based on cruiser bicycles that had a drum or coaster brake that worked by pedalling backwards.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">Ten riders descended 1,300 feet (400 m) of Repack road in about 5 minutes.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">As mountain biking grew during the 80s, downhill riders continued to use either rigid or limited-travel suspension bicycles. Purpose-made downhill bikes started to appear in the 90s, with innovations such as dual crown forks and disc brakes, as well as more elaborate suspension designs.</p>
                    <p class="text-white mb-4">Later, riders from other disciplines began focusing on downhill, such as BMX racers. Their influence is seen in the increased difficulty of many courses, with bigger jumps and drops added. The coming of age for downhill biking was its inclusion at the first UCI Mountain Bike Championship, held in 1990 in Durango, Colorado.</p>
